  ## Description
  Created a simple text editor app that can function online. Needed to use a variety of data persistence options in order to ensure that data is not lost in any scenario. The application first looks to use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that it will use local storage.
  
  AS A developer
  
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with an internet connection
  
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
